## Introduction

Based initially on [this article](https://aosabook.org/en/500L/dagoba-an-in-memory-graph-database.html), benoni is an in-memory graph database. Initially built to understand the inner-workings of graph databases, this project provides a simple solution to working with graph-based data without having to spin up and actual DB instance. It is a great option for POC applications or just for your own understanding.

## Tasks

- [ ] write code example as given in article
- [ ] write tests around use cases
- [ ] refactor code to use typescript
